## Why

While researching, it is common to create and reproduce experiments. This repository aims to organize all my experiments in a single source. Each experiment here is independent and completely decoupled from others.

## Quickstart

Most of my experiments are using [Docker](docker-website). You must install it in your workstation before reproducing ony of those. Alternatively, you can use [our devcontainer](devcontainer-folder).

## Usage

All my experiments are inside the [experiments folder](experiments-folder). There, you can navigate to the experiment you want to reproduce and read the `README.md` file of that experiment. That file will explain everything you need to know to reproduce that given experiment.
